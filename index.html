		I was born in the town of Tinley Park, which is located in the south suburbs of Chicago. After graduating from Victor J. Andrew High School, I enrolled
		at Illinois State University. After changing majors from Communications to Political Science, I transferred over to DePaul University in Chicago. After
		graduating with my Bachelor's Degree I continued working at Let's Play Entertainment as an assistant manager. In January of 2018 I enrolled at Coding
		Temple.

			<h2>Why Coding Temple?</h2>
			<p>After I graduated from DePaul University with my Political Science degree I worked as an assistant manager for a few years at a place called
			Lets Play Entertainment. The work was fine, but eventually I wanted to move into a career as opposed to what I viewed as a job. Like countless
			others before me I found out that the job market can be brutal out there. Findings jobs that I was qualified for that was more than a sales job
			was difficult. No offense to people in sales, but that path isn't for me. I wanted to do something that would keep me motivated and looking
			forward to the future, and I wasn't finding it on any of the interviews I was going on or the jobs I was finding.
			<br></br>
			Over the holidays a family member had asked me why I never considered doing coding work before. I'm big into technology and did in fact take a
			course in college that taught me some basic HTML and CSS, but that obviously wasn't enough knowledge to get a job. My relative told me about
			bootcamps and specifically mentioned hearing about Coding Temple. I never knew this was an option until then, and I immediately went home and
			researched. I enjoyed doing my experiences with coding during college and I always was curious about learning more, so I applied for Coding
			Temple.
			<br></br>
			I'm looking for a career where I can see the fruits of my labor and where I'm not just going to be doing cold calls all day and end up being
			miserable. I want to work with technology and be able to be a valuable asset to an employer. Computers aren't going anywhere, and I'm excited
			to learn a skill that will be immensly valuable in the world today. Although the excitement comes with a healthy dose of nerves, I can't wait
			to get started on the next chapter of my life.

			<h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
			<p>In my spare time I love watching movies. I've always been one to view film as an artform and not just as pure mindless entertainment. I end
			up spending way too much money on going to the theater every year, but I end up doing it every year so I can't complain too much. There's
			something fascinating about watching the actors play out the director's vision of a screenwriter's words and still being able to make your own
			interpretations afterwards.
			<br></br>
			Outside of that, I'm a big sports fan. I watch a good amount of everything, but my top three are probably baseball, soccer, and hockey. Baseball
			is easily my favorite sports, and I spend a good amount of time in the summer at White Sox games. In addition to going to games, I'm one of
			those stat nerds, so I spend a solid portion of time going over advanced statistics and plotting out ideal lineups.
			<br></br>
			I do play video games, pretty much primarily on Xbox. I'm not some hardcore gamer or anything, but it's nice to wind down with some friends and
			mess around to wind down after a long day. Outside of that I enjoy a nice glass of beer and hanging out with my friends.
